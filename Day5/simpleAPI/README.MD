# call back function 

JS is a as asyncronous language, which do not wait for anyone, 
it will send the data for process and come back to it only when the work is done and send to resposible place 



for example, 
there is a office where there is a helper, 
 -> 1st person came in office and wanna meet Boss
 -> 2nd person came and wanna meet a Manager 
 -> 3rd person came and wanna a go to kitchen 

 now here the helper will firstly take 
 -> the 1st person to Boss and return to 2nd person 
 -> he will take 2nd person to Manager and return to 3rd person 
 in this process if the first person finish his work with boss then the helper will firstly take the 1st person back and work for 3rd person.....

Note: the helper is going back to complete his work, so the process of going back to its place to complete the work is called call back function 

The above example explains the asyncronous function of JS.
